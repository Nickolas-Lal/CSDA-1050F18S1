### Sprint 2
Sprint 2 contains the modelling/analysis phase of the project. In this case the Sprint contains an attempt at forecasting the average rent price in Toronto. This can be very useful for prospective renters, landlords, and the City of Toronto. The code and rationale is in the notebook. A refined version of all deliverables including the full written report and video presentation will be submitted at the end of the course.
